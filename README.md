# Text-Generator-APP

Welcome to the Team Feedback Analyzer project repository! This project aims to streamline the feedback process within teams by collecting, analyzing, and distributing 360-degree feedback in an efficient and anonymous manner.

##Getting Started
To use this application, follow these steps:

##Download LM Studio: LM Studio must be downloaded to utilize the custom text generation capabilities of the project. You can download LM Studio from LM Studio's website.

##Download Model: Once LM Studio is installed, download a suitable language model. For this project, we recommend using the Dolphin 2.2.1 Mistral model for optimal performance.

##Run Local Server: Start LM Studio's local server to enable the text generation functionality locally.

##Usage
Main.py
The main.py file hosts a simplified custom ChatGPT application created using PyQt. This application can be used to interact with the text generation model and analyze feedback in real-time.

##App.py
The App.py file can be used to automatically analyze feedback data stored in an Excel folder and send the analysis results via email. This automated process streamlines the feedback distribution process within the team.

##Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
